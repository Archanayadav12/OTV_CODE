matplotlib
python-pptx
Run the Code:
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (as mentioned above).
Place the Dataset -2_new.xlsx file in the same directory as the script, or update the file path in the script accordingly.
Run the Python script OTV_CODW.PY:
After running the script, the visualizations will be saved as PNG images in the specified directory, and a PowerPoint presentation will be created with these images.
